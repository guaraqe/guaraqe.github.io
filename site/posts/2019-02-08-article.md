title: "Brownian-like deviation of neighboring cells in the early embryogenesis of the zebrafish"
summary: Research paper on cell movement patterns during zebrafish embryonic development
---

I published an article in _Physical Biology_ with my PhD supervisors: Paul Bourgine, Denis Grebenkov and Nadine Peyri√©ras.

In this article we investigate how neighboring cells deviate from each other during the early embryogenesis of the zebrafish. The main discovery of the article is that this motion is similar to Brownian motion, having independent increments. However, the distribution of each increment is not Gaussian, and we give a model that fits it well.
