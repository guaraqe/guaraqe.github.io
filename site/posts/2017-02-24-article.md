title: "Cell trajectory clustering: towards the automated identification of morphogenetic fields in animal embryogenesis"
---

I published a conference article at _ICPRAM_ with my PhD supervisors: Paul Bourgine, Denis Grebenkov and Nadine Peyri√©ras.

In this article we propose an algorithm to cluster cells during embryogenesys in a way that respects both cell positions and their genealogy. The solution is inspired by path integrals from quantum mechanics, which is interesting.
