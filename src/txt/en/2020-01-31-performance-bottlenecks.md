title: Locating performance bottlenecks in large Haskell codebases
---

I wrote a post for [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io) on a profiling technique for locating performance bottlenecks on Haskell code that is suitable for large codebases.
You can find it [here](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-01-30-haskell-profiling/).
