  Hello, my name is <b>Juan Raphael Diaz Simões</b>.

  I work as a software engineering consultant for Tweag, mainly with Haskell, Nix and functional programming-related tech stacks. I have more than 5 years of experience in different environments and companies, ranging from academia to banking and logistics. I am the project lead for my latest mission. I am an editor for the company technical blog.
